# XSS Vulnerability Test

This Python script checks for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in a web application.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [Python Official Website](https://www.python.org/).

2. Install the required Python libraries using pip:

3. Clone the repository or download the `xssvulnerabilitytest.py` file.

4. Open the script and modify the `target_url` variable to the URL of the web application you want to test for XSS vulnerability.

5. Run the script:
python xssvulnerabilitytest.py


The script will send a malicious XSS payload to the specified URL and check for indications of a potential XSS vulnerability.

## Functionality

The `check_xss_vulnerability()` function sends a malicious XSS payload to the specified URL and checks the response for indications of a vulnerability.

- `url (str)`: The URL of the web application to test for XSS vulnerability.

If the payload is found in the response, it suggests a potential XSS vulnerability, and the script will notify you.

## Configuration

- `target_url` (str): Set this variable to the URL of the web application you want to test.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) library
